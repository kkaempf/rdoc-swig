Generating RDoc (Ruby 1.8) documentation from SWIG input (*.i) files

Since I made the experience that using SWIGs %doc mechanism is clumsy
to use, I did a closer look at the the parsing files of RDoc.

rdoc_swig is the result. It directly parses comments from a SWIG input
(typically .i) file and generates RDoc documentation.

Just call the local 'rdoc' script. It will pick up the parse_swig.rb
file and call the installed 'rdoc'. There's no difference to behavior
of the normal 'rdoc' tool.
